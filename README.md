### What I learned

The biggest thing I learned from this project is that I need to prioritize structure and plnaning before actually writing out code. I feel like my current code is kinda sloopy and all over the place at times.

### Continued development

- Conditional rendering based on viewport
- Smarter use of padding/margins along with grid/flex to create more dynamic components instead of locked in width/heights
